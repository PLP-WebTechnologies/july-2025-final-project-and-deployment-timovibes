                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Founded in 2025 by a group of professional procrastinators (Yator), The Excuse Department was born from a simple realization: everyone needs a good excuse, but not everyone has the creativity to craft one.</p>
                
                <p>It all started when our founder missed an important meeting because he was "conducting critical research on the aerodynamics of paper airplanes." Instead of getting fired, she got promoted. That's when he knew he had a gift.</p>
                
                <p>Today, we're the world's leading provider of creative, believable, and utterly ridiculous excuses for any situation. Our team of professional excuse artists works around the clock (well, when they're not using their own excuses to avoid work) to bring you the finest in fictional justifications.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>To make the world a more interesting place, one creative excuse at a time. We believe that life is too short for boring explanations and that sometimes, the best truth is a really good lie.</p>
