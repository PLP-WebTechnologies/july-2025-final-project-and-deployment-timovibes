                    <div class="faq-answer">We guarantee they're creative! Whether they work depends on your delivery and the gullibility of your audience. Results may vary based on your acting skills.</div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Do you offer refunds?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Sorry, all sales are final. But if you're unsatisfied, we'll give you a really good excuse for why we can't refund your money.</div>

                <div class="faq-item">

                    <div class="faq-answer">We recommend variety! Using "my goldfish is having surgery" more than twice might raise suspicions about your goldfish's health insurance.</div>
                </div>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Do you have excuses for illegal activities?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Absolutely not! We only provide excuses for harmless social situations. For legal matters, consult a lawyer (who probably needs our services too).</div>

                <div class="faq-item">

                    <div class="faq-answer">Our standard turnaround is 24-48 hours, but we offer rush services for excuse emergencies. Additional fees apply for same-day creative crises.</div>
